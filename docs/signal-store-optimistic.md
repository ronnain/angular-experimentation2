# Query/Mutation Effects

This tool provides flexible ways to handle side effects between queries and mutations, such as optimistic updates, patching, and reloading. These can be configured either imperatively (via options \_> `queriesEffects` in `withMutation`) or declaratively (via the `on` property in `withQuery`).

## Imperative Effects

Imperative configuration is done by passing an options object to `withMutation`. This allows you to specify how mutations affect queries directly.

### Example: Imperative Mutation Effects

```typescript
withMutation(
	'user',
	(store) => mutation({ ... }),
	() => ({
		queriesEffects: {
			userQueryById: {
				optimistic: ({ mutationParams, queryResource, queryIdentifier }) => ({
					...queryResource.value(),
					...mutationParams,
				}),
				optimisticPatch: {
					email: ({ mutationParams }) => mutationParams.email,
				},
				reload: {
					onMutationLoading: true,
					onMutationResolved: true,
				},
			},
		},
	})
)
```

**Supported Effects:**

- `optimistic`: Replace the query value with the mutation params.
- `optimisticPatch`: Patch specific fields in the query value.
- `reload`: Reload the query when the mutation is loading or resolved.
- `filter`: Target specific queries by identifier. (Mandatory when working with a `queryById` or `mutationById`)

## Declarative Effects (Recommended)

Declarative configuration is done inside `withQuery` using the `on` property. This allows you to declare how queries should react to mutations. (The mutations should be declared before the query)

### Example: Declarative Query Effects

```typescript
withQuery(
	'user',
	() => query({ ... }),
	(store) => ({
		on: {
			userMutation: {
				optimisticUpdate: ({ mutationParams }) => mutationParams,
				optimisticPatch: {
					name: ({ mutationParams }) => mutationParams.name,
				},
				reload: {
					onMutationLoading: true,
					onMutationResolved: true,
				},
			},
		},
	})
)
```

**Supported Effects:**

- `optimistic`: Replace the query value with the mutation params.
- `optimisticPatch`: Patch specific fields in the query value.
- `reload`: Reload the query when the mutation is loading or resolved.
- `filter`: Target specific queries by identifier. (Mandatory when working with a `queryById` or `mutationById`)

## Data Flow Principle - Best Practices

Query state represents the server state in your application. When a query state changes, any associated client state is automatically updated. For the most efficient workflow:

1. Associate query results with dedicated client state
2. When performing mutations, use optimistic updates on the query state
3. Let the changes automatically flow to the client state

This approach maintains a single source of truth and ensures consistency between server and client representations.
